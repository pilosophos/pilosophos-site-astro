# The Conversation Game

The Conversation Game is a game for two players, where each player tries to steer the conversation towards a certain topic without being too obvious. I made this game to practice my conversation skills.

## Rules

<aside class="marginal-note text-base muted not-prose"><p>(Optional): To prevent cheating, each player could write their question on a piece of paper before the game starts, and players could reveal the paper at the end.</p></aside>

Each player selects an icebreaker question (e.g. `What's your favorite ice cream flavor?`) which they will keep hidden from the other player. The game has one winner, and you can win by one of three methods:
* You obtain the answer to your icebreaker question from the other player
* You successfully guess what the other player's icebreaker question is within three guesses
* The other player has incorrectly guessed what your icebreaker question is three times

If a player believes they've won, they should declare what their icebreaker question is and the answer to that question.

Either player can start talking first.

## Multi-round variant

If players want to keep going after someone has won, the winner selects a new icebreaker question and the loser's incorrect guess count resets to 0.

The loser may select a new icebreaker question also, at the cost of resetting the winner's incorrect guess count to 0 as well.

When the players decide to stop playing the Conversation Game, they may compare the number of times they won, and whoever has the most wins is the overall winner.

## More than two players?

If you have suggestions for how to adapt this to more than 2 players, please send them to [pilosophos@gmail.com](mailto:pilosophos@gmail.com).
