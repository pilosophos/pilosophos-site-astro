A character I made for a friend's Pokémon tabletop RPG.

She's a 1st year PhD student at Orange Islands University studying abroad. Val always carries an Up Ramen so that her Pokémon, Kyle the Totodile, can use Scald and make an instant lunch. This is, of course, only a last resort in case she is unable to find any free food on campus.
