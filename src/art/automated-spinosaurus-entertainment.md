Someone commissioned me for a set of Discord server icons based on various esoteric names, like "Automated Spinosaurus Entertainment."

Spinosaurus are 94-100 million years ago that could have weighed up to 7,400 kg.

What's funny to me is that a lot of dinosaur fact pages will list the dino's weight, which is always an absurdly large number that I can never fully put into perspective. Once you get to four or more decimal places all I can really say is, "Yep, that sure is a heavy dinosaur."
