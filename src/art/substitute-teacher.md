I have a little substitute doll which I sometimes put in front of my webcam if I go AFK in a zoom meeting.

Originally when I got the doll, I was at one of the Pokémon Centers in Tokyo, where I overheard a middle-aged lady say to another, "what the heck is this Pokémon supposed to be anyway?", which was how I found out where all the substitute dolls are.
