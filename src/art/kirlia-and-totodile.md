I asked the DM of my Pokémon TTRPG if there were any restrictions on what my trainer's Pokémon should be other than being 5th level, he just said "nah restrictions are lame"

Then when I presented Kyle the Totodile with 492 EVs and Dragon Dance, he laughed a big laugh and now I have to justify Kyle's power.

So now Kyle takes dance classes for university credit as part of his backstory.

Someday he'll earn a BA in Modern Dance.
