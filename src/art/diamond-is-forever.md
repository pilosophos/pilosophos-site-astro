The third in a line of James Bond x Pok√©spe parodies that I drew, based on [this poster](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066995/mediaviewer/rm646519041/) for *Diamonds are Forever*.

I saw this movie just before drawing the poster, and I thought it was... pretty alright. Entertaining enough, but not very memorable. I like the scene where [Q explains his slot machine cheating device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGYikSmE4VY) and then gets ignored in the middle of his explanation. I love that guy.
