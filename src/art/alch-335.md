I drew this for Witchtober 2024, where you're supposed to draw a witch every day (or two days, etc.) of October, each day with a different theme like "recipe" or "broom". I lost interest and stopped after 4 drawings. I originally intended to do a running theme where everything was a course offered by a school of witchcraft.

[Philology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philology) is the study of historical texts, so you could imagine trying to read a busted up old alchemical codex and brewing up an ancient potion or something.
