I have the biggest crush on Ace Attorney's Mia Fey. I went to the Capcom store in Shibuya PARCO a couple years ago, and imagine my disappointment when there's no Mia Fey merch (or any other Ace Attorney merch for that matter).

If anyone at Capcom merchandising is reading this, you should make one of those Staples *that was easy* buttons except it says "Objection!" when you press it. Also make some official Mia Fey 1/8 scale figs, thanks!
