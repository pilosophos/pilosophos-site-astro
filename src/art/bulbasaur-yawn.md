Drawn for the Pok√©earth collab celebrating the 20th anniversary of Bulbagarden, which hosts Bulbapedia.

Bulbagarden was originally a forum called Bulbasaur's Mysterious Garden Forum, named after the anime episode, [Bulbasaur's Mysterious Garden](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/EP051). The forum is actually still going, but with the sad decline of forums and the rise of Discord, it's not nearly as active as it used to be.
