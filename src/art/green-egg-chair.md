For some reason Green changes shoes between the RBGY chapters, one of which is a pair of go-go boots which were popular in the 70s, and by association reminded me of those egg-shaped chairs in Men in Black designed in 1968.

I've never sat in one of these chairs, but they don't look all that comfortable to me.
