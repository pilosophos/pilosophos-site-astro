I've drawn Rosy [before](/art/camille-grey) but I didn't go into any of her equipment at the time, since I actually decided on a character design before I started going into equipment. I decided to rebrand the cyberarm from Ares to a Yamatetsu I found in the SR2 book. I thought it would be more in-theme for her, since everything else is from a Japanese vendor anyway.

For this illustration I decided to try cell shading, which I stopped doing for a while, but I think this turned out really well! What do you think?
