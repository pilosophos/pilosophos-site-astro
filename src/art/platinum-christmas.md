Diamond's POV: you're baking poffins for Christmas with Platinum when she shows up early at your kitchen window

I wish all you CommonerShippers a very happy new year hehe

I made a sketch of something like this in April but I decided to make a colored, Christmas version. I intended to finish by Christmas, but life does life things. Hey, at least it's in time for new years!
