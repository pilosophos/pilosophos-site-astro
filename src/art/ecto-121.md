I drew this for Witchtober 2024, where you're supposed to draw a witch every day (or two days, etc.) of October, each day with a different theme like "recipe" or "broom". I lost interest and stopped after 4 drawings. I originally intended to do a running theme where everything was a course offered by a school of witchcraft.

Now, I've never actually seen Ghostbusters (\*gasp!*) but I do think the proton packs are pretty cool. Also huge shoutout to the Poltergust in Luigi's Mansion. Love that stuff.
