There's a really great manga artist (who draws a lot of NSFW), Endou Okito, whose style I really admire because he makes everything look so delicate and refined.

I tried to emulate his style with desaturated colors, hatching, and adding some detail and texture, but I'm not sure it's quite where I want it to be. The lines feel a bit too heavy maybe. I still think it came out quite nicely, though.
