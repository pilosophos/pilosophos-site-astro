At some point I started envisioning the Pokéspe characters Green and Silver as spy movie protagonists, so I came up with a play on the James Bond movie, *From Russia With Love*, and swapped Russia out for Johto. Not satisfied with stopping there, I actually went and *watched* the movie, which I did enjoy.

After this, I started watching more movies and coming up with more James Bond x Pokéspe parody posters, like *Diamond is Forever* <span class="muted">(starring best boy, Diamond)</span>, Dr. O <span class="muted">(named after the masked stranger that Green battles)</span>, and Game Corner Royale.
