Ever since I played Shadowrun, the juxtaposition of something so traditionally fantastic as faeries with the harsh reality of a capitalist cyberscape has really stuck with me over the years.

This drawing takes place in Malaszec, an old magical cyberpunk worldbuilding project of mine. It's also a re-imagining of another drawing with a similar concept I did a couple years before.
