I finished drawing my shadowrunner from earlier this month, who I’ve named Camille Grey, a decker who is extracting data from a Cray supercomputer being used as nightclub seating

Shadowrun story below, if it interests you:

Just before being laid off, Vic Dayton, a former Ares Macrotechnology project manager, stole the backdoor keys to a line of autonomous Ares security drones. Now living out of his brother’s nightclub, Vic starts negotiating for the sale of the keys with two rival companies, both of whom suspect that he’s secretly dealing with the other. Preferring not to let the keys fall into the hands of the other company, both hire shadowrunners to track him and his keys down.

After investigating Vic’s Matrix accounts and even his room above the nightclub, Camille’s team have ended up with absolutely nothing to show for their search efforts. Just as they were about to give up, Camille discovers something crucial: around the same time Vic had been fired, the nightclub had purchased a set of seats from a vintage store for an unusually expensive price.

These seats were, in fact, vintage Cray supercomputers, and Camille suspects that Vic hidden the keys in plain sight within the club seating.

Returning to the nightclub, and she slowly extracts the keys from the Cray’s ancient hard drives, which weigh several dozen kilos.

Right in the middle of the process, the rival shadowrunner team arrives to search the club discreetly. To stall them, Camille stirs up a panic at the disco by using one of the backdoor keys on the club’s Ares bouncer drones to fire restraining nets into the clubbers, while hacking the AV system to blast a scary message.

When the extraction process is over, they smash the hard drive platters and hightail it out of the club, leaving in their wake a crowd of distressed clubbers, rogue drones, and a financially ruined Vic Dayton.
