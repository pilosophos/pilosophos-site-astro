After visiting NYC I envisioned the Unova Battle Subway as an actual mass transit service, and started working on this drawing. It's sat unfinished in my hard drive for nearly a year now, and I've finally just decided to just go ahead and finish it.

The Unova Battle Subway isn't too different from the MTA; either way, someone will eventually challenge you to a battle with an oversized rat he keeps in his pocket.

[OMNY](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Omny) is the name of the NYC MTA's train pass. Apparently there's a scam where students would sell their free Student OMNY passes and then declare them as stolen to invalidate it and get a new one from their school, then rinse and repeat.
