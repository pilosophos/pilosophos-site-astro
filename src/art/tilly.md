On the ~tilde.town modded Minecraft server, I built the Tilde.Town Transit railway network using the Create mod, which lets you hire mobs to drive your trains. Tilly is the mascot of the 2 Line between Spawn and ~Nebula Stations, inspired by the copious mascots characters that exist for just about everything in Japan.
