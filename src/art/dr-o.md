The fourth in a line of James Bond x Pokéspe parodies that I drew, based on [this poster](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0055928/mediaviewer/rm2548150017/) for *Dr. No*.

The Pokémon League chapters of Pokéspe have this wonderful panel where Green uses her Blastoise as a friggin' jetpack, and it always astounded me how she manages to fly in every way imaginable without a flying-type Pokémon. I'd take a Blastoise over a Walther PPK any day.

Dr. No features several ladies wearing Cheongsam (sometimes simply known as a Chinese dress), which is one of the most common alternate costumes in Anime for good reason, because it's so damn pretty. I originally intended to draw a more complicated pattern for Green's dress here, but I lost patience at some point.
