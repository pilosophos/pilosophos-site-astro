  I have a bunch of computers networked together that I call a homelab. It's not very high budget, and in fact most of it is hand-me-down or scavenged from the trash <span class="muted">(and then disinfected)</span>.

      <p class="mb-5">A hand-me-down laptop from a friend of mine who was upgrading. It's fairly large, so I don't carry it around with me. There's a billion cables attached at all times anyway, so it would be a huge pain. I'd like to build my own beast of a computer someday, but it's not like I'm keeping up with any triple-A game titles these days, so what I have works fine.</p>

            <li>I use both the integrated and discrete GPU since I have it connected to two monitors: a Huion Kamvas display tablet and some Viewsonic monitor. The Huion is mounted to this swivel arm thingy so I can pull it from a typical monitor position down to my desk to draw on it.</li>
            <li>The SSD was originally a measly 120 GB boot drive, which started to fail after a while so I replaced it with a 1TB one.</li>
            <li>I bought a 2x8 GB kit and added a stick to the server after my travel laptop's RAM failed, bringing my server from 8 to 16 GB.</li>

        <p>My home server is also a hand-me-down laptop, this time from my family. A laptop might be an unusual choice for a server, but I like to think of it as a server with a built in UPS and monitor*, which has come in handy every now and then. It's quiet enough that I can sleep next to it daily, which is important since I live in a microscopic studio apartment.</p>
        <small>* I later discovered the battery had become what's known as a Spicy Pillow (technical term), so that had to go.</small>

              <li>The server recieved a RAM upgrade from 8 to 16 GB after I started hosting a Enigmatica 6 Expert server, which consumes a ridiculous amount of RAM. I actually don't think this is enough, especially with the other services running. I don't want to spend even more money, so I increased the swapfile to 6 GB which at least keeps it from OOMing.</li>
              <li>I previously used Airsonic for music, but I moved to Jellyfin to handle movies and TV also. Unfortunately, the Android app has problems playing back certain formats for unknown reasons, but the web interface seems to work fine.</li>

      <p>A trusty Thinkpad that's small enough to carry around. I used to have an L420 which was massive and broke my back every time I had to lug it around. Shame it doesn't have the old style keyboards which were way nicer to type on.</p>
